    <!-- Block elements are those elements which take whole width of the page eg div, para, heading, ul, li-->

    <!-- Inline elements are those elements which does not take whole width of the page eg span, anchor, img, em etc. Span is used to add a chanable word in a para or line so the word dont take extra space since we change its value and at the same time it should be between the para eg in weather app final forcast. -->
    
    <!-- Eg. of span tag
    Today's temperature will be <span id = "degree">34</span> degree C. -->
    <!-- Now we can change the degree, doesnt matter it is inside the para and it also dont take full page width. If i dont use span so there is no tag which I can use inside the para and change its value and that will not take whole width. If I use div tag instead of span here then it will take whole width of the page inside the para which is not good. -->
